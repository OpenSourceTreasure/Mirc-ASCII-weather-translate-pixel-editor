# Mario-MSL
Mario like game coded in mIRC scripting language

Installation :

"Cool" features (for mIRC anyway):
- Dynamic map loading - can load huge maps very fast, and does not influence FPS
- Can render lots of animated tiles at the same time very quickly

- Special objects library that allow somewhat cleaner code than usual with msl
