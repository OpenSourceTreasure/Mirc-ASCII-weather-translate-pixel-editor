This is a collection of a few irc scripts and a bot that work together.
Install the bot based on the below instructions.
Place the scripts files in the correct directory
Load your irc server - I used unrealircd.
Load Mirc. 
Go to the dir where the bot is and open Terminal. Type: node index.js
In C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\mIRC\scripts\irc-translate-bot-main - change Boca Raton to whatever city you'd like.
The channels default to #Ken - you may change that in the channels.js files

ðŸ’¡ Quick Install via Zip

âœ… Download both Zip files and put them where it says. Read on, and learn what the capabilities are, and of course the code (non-zip) version.

Usage:

!weather - for the weather

/pe - pixel editor

-es words (Google Translate - change es for any two letter language code and "words" for what you want to translate!)

Go to Commands in Mirc for Mario and Pixel Editor

Where a directory refers to "kenny" instead of "name" - same idea, change it to whatever it is on your end...

This is what it should look like when you use it:

# irc-translate-bot
An irc translation bot using Google Translate, works for every language.
It it located here - https://github.com/forerosantiago/irc-translate-bot

## Installation

First, clone this repository and cd into it:
```
git clone https://github.com/forerosantiago/irc-translate-bot && cd irc-translate-bot/
```

Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Edit the `config.json` file:
```
{
    "nick": "Translator",
    "server": "irc.planetofnix.com"
}
```

Execute it:
```
node index.js
```

## Usage
Once the bot is running and connected to an irc server you can use it like this:

```
-es Text to be translated
```

The command is the iso code for the desired language, a list of all the iso language codes can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).


### Joining and leaving channels
You can make the bot join any channel you want using the irc `/invite` commmand, the bot will remember it and join again if it gets disconnected.

If you don't want the bot to be in your channel anymore you can simply use the `/kick` command with it, it will forget your channel and won't come back unless reinvited.

âœ… Play Mario 

âœ… Translate

âœ… Get the weather

âœ… Use a pixel editor
